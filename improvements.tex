Time was a major factor in deciding which sections of the SPB paper where most important to implement. A key section that was included in the final project was a genuine private and public key pair for signing messages. This would have been used to prevent malicious nodes from falsely claiming to be another node since only the real node knows the private key.

Other aspects that could have been improved are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Reworking the DHT re-balancing system
  \begin{itemize}
      \item Currentely
  \end{itemize}
  \item Another entry in the list
\end{itemize}
